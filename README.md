## Description
The Magic 8-Ball is a plastic sphere, made to look like an eight-ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. 
It was invented in 1950 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel. 
The user asks a yesâ€“no question to the ball and then turns it over to reveal an answer in a window on the ball.
More on [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball).

The presented version is a console analogue in the `Ruby` language.

## Usage
Just think of a question that can be answered "Yes" or "No", concentrate very, very hard, and...

Run the command below in your system console.
```shell
ruby 8ball.rb
```
In the folder where the 8ball.rb file is located, of course.
